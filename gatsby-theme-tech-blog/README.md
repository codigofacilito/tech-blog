## Configuration
The project looks to provide a solid foundation for you to build on top of it. These are now some of the settings you can tune up:

| Option         | What it does                                                                 |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| contentPath    | Path to search for markdown files                                            |
| navYMLPath     | Path to search for YAML file with navigation items                           |
| basePath       | This path will prefix all the paths that the blogs generate                  |
| prefixWithDate | Boolean value, when set to true, post paths will be prefixed with their date |

```javascript
plugins: [
  {
    resolve: `gatsby-theme-tech-blog`,
    options: {
      prefixWithDate: true, // Will generate paths like 2019/12/02/foo
      basePath: '/posts' // Will generate paths like /posts/2019/12/02/foo
    }
  }
],
```

Note: If you set the `basePath` value to the root path `/` you will only see the template for all the posts if you **don't have** an `index.js` file.

## UI configuration
This project uses Theme UI to build the interface, you can configure the theme based on the one that comes with the project which you can find [here](https://github.com/codigofacilito/tech-blog/blob/master/gatsby-theme-tech-blog/src/theme.js)

## Navigation configuration
The items on the nav bar are generated based on the content of the `items.yaml` file which can be found on the `navYMLPath` which defaults to `src/nav-items`.

To add a new item to the nav bar just add an item to the `items.yaml` file with the following pattern:

```yaml
- title: About
  link: /about
```
